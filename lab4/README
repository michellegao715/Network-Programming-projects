USAGE:
javac Driver.java 
java Driver
(or java -jar lab4.jar)

About Project:
In the Driver, I use 4 threads to implement multithread web cache:
thread 1: handle service announcement(UDPDiscoveryClient--serviceAnnounce)
thread 2: handle receive announcement(UDPDiscoveryServer--build the list of IPs which is running the proxy cache)
thread 3: listen request from user(check my own cache, if don't find cache, then send request to peer, if my peer don't have, then send request to dns server.).  
thread 4: listen from peer(read response from peer)A

Test broadcast(service discovery's functionality):
1.ssh to two g12 computers: g12xx,g12xy.
2.under g12xx: java Driver
3.under g12xy: java Driver
Then the output:
(under g12xx)
Known local ip is : 138.202.171.123
Received from 138.202.171.111 cs621-cache  (this is the type of service)
(under g12xy):
Known local ip is:138.202.171.111
Received from 138.202.171.123 cs621-cache

Test proxy server:
1.On the first computer: set up firefox's proxy server, Preference- Advanced-Network-Settings-Manual proxy configuration
Http Proxy: IP of current computer, Port:5678.
2. Repeat step in the second computer. 
3. On the first computer: in terminal: java Driver 
4. On the second computer: java Driver > output & 
Then: go to a website. Wait for the first computer's program's output.

( Make sure you have NewAnnounceService.java NewAnnounceReceiver.java NewProxyServer.java NewhandlePeerResponsejava in the same directory)
