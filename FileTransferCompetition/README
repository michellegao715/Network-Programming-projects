README:
I implement a client(Client.java) and server(Server.java) both extend RequestSender which is responsible for 
sendRequest, sendResponse, error detection,building socket for connection.
For error detection, I implement CRC(calculateCRC32 and verifyCRC32) when there is communication between server and client.
FileFetcher is used by client to download file sent by server.

Run the program:
java Server -serverPort 
java Client -serverIP -serverPort -filename

Requirement:
1. Use UDP for communication
2. Use raw sockets for communication
3. May not use any libraries for reliable data transfer. Design your own protocol on your own.
