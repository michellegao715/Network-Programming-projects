Assignment4: Multi-Threaded Web Proxy. "Computer Networking A Top-Down Approach" 

In this assignment, you will develop a Web proxy. When your proxy receives an
HTTP request for an object from a browser, it generates a new HTTP request for
the same object and sends it to the origin server. When the proxy receives the
corresponding HTTP response with the object from the origin server, it creates a
new HTTP response, including the object, and sends it to the client. This proxy
will be multi-threaded, so that it will be able to handle multiple requests at the
same time.
For this assignment, the companion Web site provides the skeleton code for the
proxy server. Your job is to complete the code, and then test it by having different
browsers request Web objects via your proxy.
