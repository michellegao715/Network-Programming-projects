README:
I implement a client(Client.java) and server(Server.java) both extend RequestSender which is responsible for 
sendRequest, sendResponse, error detection,building socket for connection.
For error detection, I implement CRC(calculateCRC32 and verifyCRC32) when there is communication between server and client.
FileFetcher is used by client to download file sent by server.

Run the program:
java Server -serverPort 
java Client -serverIP -serverPort -filename
