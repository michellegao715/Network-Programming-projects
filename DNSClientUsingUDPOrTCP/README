Project description:
Design, execute and compare the performance of TCP and UDP. Analyze network traffic using Wireshark.


This readme is for compiling and running of my program.

Usage:(for the experient of reponse time comparison,see output of time consuming.)
javac DNSClient.java 
java DNClient tcp 8.8.8.8 cnn.com NS
java DNSClient udp 8.8.8.8 cnn.com NS

Execute the following experiments:
1. Response time - compare the response time for DNS queries sent via UDP versus TCP.
* Make sure to do several tests and consider reporting min, max, and average.
* Test against at least two different DNS servers.  Use traceroute to help you to reason about
differences in response time between the two servers.
2. Loss rate - compare the loss rate seen in UDP to the retransmission rate observed in TCP.
* Use the ID field for matching UDP responses with requests. 
* You will need to send several messages in order to see loss.  Experiment to design your experiment.
* Use the tcp.analysis filters in Wireshark to examine the TCP retransmission rate. 
* Generate a PDF document describing your results.  You will have at least two graphs, one for each
experiment.  You may certainly generate more graphs.  For each graph, you will have at least two
paragraphs of description.  The first paragraph will describe the setup of the experiment, for
example the IP address of the DNS server used.  The second paragraph will describe the results. 
* Note: you must submit a class DNSClient that can be run as described above, but you are welcome to
design a separate test harness that runs the experiments described above.


Run Script to run my program(for the experient of camparison of retransmission rate
and loss rate) is the file: run.sh
./run.sh > /dev/null

The result and analysis of my experient is in the file: Report.pdf
